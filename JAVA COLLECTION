Implement different operations on a set s .

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the no of test cases . Then T test cases follow. The first line of input contains an integer Q denoting the no of queries . Then in the next line are Q space separated queries .
A query can be of four types 
1. a x (inserts an element x to the set s)
2. b (prints the contents of the set s in increasing order)
3. c x (erases an element x from the set s)
4. d x (prints 1 if the element x is present in the set else print -1)
5. e (prints the size of the set s)

Output:
The output for each test case will  be space separated integers denoting the results of each query .

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= Q <= 100

Example:
Input:
2
6
a 1 a 2 a 3 b c 2 b
5
a 1 a 5 e d 5 d 2

Output:
1 2 3 1 3
2 1 -1

Explanation :
Testcase 1:
There are six queries. Queries are performed in this order
1. a 1     { insert 1 to set now set has {1} }
2. a 2     {inserts 2 to set now set has {1,2} }
3. a 3     {inserts 3 to set now set has {1,2,3} }
4. b        {prints the set contents ie 1,2,3}
5. c 2     {removes 2 from the set }
6. b        {prints the set contents ie 1,3}

Testcase 2:
There are five queries. Queries are performed in this order
1. a 1     {inserts 1 to set now set has {1}}
2. a 11   {inserts 11 to set now set has {1,11}}
3. e        {prints the size of the set ie 2}
4. d 5     {since five is present prints 1}
5. d 2     {since 2 is not present in the set prints -1}


OUTPUT:
mport java.util.*;

class GfG {

    /* inserts an element x to the set s */
    void insert(Set<Integer> s, int x) {
        s.add(x);
    }

    /* prints the contents of the set s in ascending order */
    void print_contents(Set<Integer> s) {
        ArrayList<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(s);
        Collections.sort(list);

        for (int x : list) {
            System.out.print(x + " ");
        }
    }

    /* erases an element x from the set s */
    void erase(Set<Integer> s, int x) {
        s.remove(x);
    }

    /* returns the size of the set s */
    int size(Set<Integer> s) {
        return s.size();
    }

    /* returns 1 if the element x is present in set s else returns -1 */
    int find(Set<Integer> s, int x) {
        return s.contains(x) ? 1 : -1;
    }
}
